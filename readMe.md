# 🌟 Welcome to My Flutter Journey 🚀

Hey there! I'm Rutik Patil, and this repository is a reflection of my journey into the world of **Flutter** — It's a Google's UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## 📘 About This Repo

This repository will serve as my personal notebook, playground, and code dump for all things Flutter. Whether it's basic widgets, animations, or small projects — everything I explore will be added here as I continue learning.

> Stay tuned for updates and fun Flutter experiments! 🎯

🌈 Happy Fluttering!
